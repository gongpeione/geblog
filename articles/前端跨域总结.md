# How to make cross-domain request via JavaScript

## Background

Because of the [Same Origin Policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy), you cannot make an ajax request if you don't have same domain and port. But sometimes we just need to send and get data from other website or you own website with a different port, so here is the cross-domain. You can easily make a cross-domain request with some little tricks.

## How to make cross-domain request

There are several ways to make a cross-domain request, `CORS` `JSONP` `postMessage` `window.name` `location.hash` etc. Some of these ways are quite quirks, but others are very easy to use. I'm gonna introduce four methods, I think they are more "modern".

### Cross-origin resource sharing

Cross-origin resource sharing(AKA CORS)

### JSONP
